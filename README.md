# Nuclei - a Course Selection Web App
Introducing Nuclei, an attempt at a better course selection web app than Talos, the one that Bronx Science is currently using. It was made with a ExpressJs/NodeJs and Google Firebase Realtime Database back end, and designed with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Materialize front end.

On the login website, one can login with their credentials for either side and signup for the first time. 
On the user side, a student can select their courses, appeal for a class, and view the course guide.
On the administration side, a counselor can view their students with their respective selections and appeals.

I am using a rather limited (and fake) set of data for this project. What you see is to provides the best idea of what Nuclei can be.
